# 🍃 EcoNudge: Predictive Campus Resource Optimization

**Built for AMD Slingshot 2026 | Theme: Sustainable AI & Green Tech**

## 📌 The Problem
College campuses operate like small cities, consuming massive amounts of energy daily. Currently, resource management relies on reactive monitoring that only flags waste *after* it has occurred. Without predictive insights, facilities waste significant energy heating, cooling, or powering unoptimized sectors.

## 💡 Our AI Solution
EcoNudge is a lightweight, AI-driven dashboard that shifts campus sustainability from reactive to proactive. By analyzing historical power consumption and localized weather forecasts, our machine learning engine predicts energy surges before they happen.

Instead of passive data observation, EcoNudge delivers **Automated Actionable Nudges**. When the AI predicts a surge exceeding optimal thresholds, it immediately flags the exact sector, allowing facility wardens to optimize HVAC systems and cut emissions instantly.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
* **Frontend:** Streamlit (Python) for rapid, interactive dashboard deployment.
* **AI Engine:** Scikit-Learn (Random Forest Regressor) for lightweight, high-accuracy tabular predictions.
* **Data Processing:** Pandas & NumPy for time-series feature engineering.
